make controls easy understand possible know broad service people use lot things number controls try make easy possible put controls front people configure experience way want thank congressman think makes sense discuss agree broader point think making internet technology overall becoming much important part lives companies technology industry growing congressman certainly something consider although one thing push back think often characterized maybe mistakes happen conflict people business interests actually think case think lot hard decisions come different interests different people example one hand people want ability sign apps bring information bring friend information order social experience hand everyone wants information locked completely private question business question much equities weigh congressman well lot things europeans think think gdpr general going positive step internet codifies lot things things done long time things think good steps take example controls requires generally controls privacy controls offered around world years putting tools front people repeatedly settings putting front people getting making sure people understand controls get affirmative consent think good thing done periodically past think makes sense think something gdpr require positive need think congressman specifically aware threat general number national security election integrity-type issues focus try take broad view input get intelligence community well encouraging look specific things effectively work congressman important question couple standards strongest one things cause physical harm threats physical harm broader standard hate speech speech might make people feel broadly uncomfortable unsafe community congressman important question think one struggle continuously question hate speech versus legitimate political speech think something get criticized left right definitions nuanced try try lay community standards public documents make sure office get look definitions area think society sensibilities also shifting quickly also different crosstalk agree congressman thank 2014 announced change someone could sign app share data also could share basic information friends 2014 major change said going able share information friends friend happen playing game together app listening music together app could information signed authorized app people able share information friends basic issue 300,000 people used poll came app ultimately sold cambridge analytica cambridge analytica access many 87 million people information possible today today 300,000 people used app app might information 300,000 people thank congressman sitting today remember lot specifics early saw generally bunch app developers asking permissions access people data ways connected functioning app say okay want log app share content even though app actually use reasonable way looked said hey right review apps make sure app developer going ask someone access data actually reason want access time made series changes culminated major change 2014 referenced ultimately made person could sign bring friends information anymore congressman difficult ever guarantee single bad actors every problem around security sort arms race people trying abuse systems responsibility make hard possible take necessary precautions company scale think responsibility growing scale need make sure congressman yes politically although think hear hear kind normal political speech certainly going allow ads terrorist content example banning views crosstalk sorry could repeat congresswoman using service share photo example say want friends see news feed facebook friends going see go website want sign website website ask say hey things want get access order use website. sign seeing screen website asking certain information also authorizing website access information turned platform completely control left able sign another website go reactivate even work congresswoman think settings signing app quite clear terms every time go sign app go whole screen says app friends use pieces information like access to. make decision whether sign yes say want sign nothing gets shared similarly terms sharing content every single time go upload photo make decision right top says sharing friends publicly group every single time quite clear cases yes think quite clear congresswoman typically two things settings page settings one place case want go play around configure settings important thing putting settings line trying make decision going share photo think setting want share photo line right going sign app think clear right line signing app permissions app asking one place settings want go line relevant place repeat piece well congresswoman think privacy something ever understanding issues people interact online grows time think figure social norms rules want put place five years come back learned things either social norms evolved company practices evolved put rules place think understanding going evolve quite long time expect even state like california forward-leaning necessarily going mean fully understand everything solved issues congresswoman know answer top head get back believe served like button pages know number pages like button actively know answer exactly top head either something follow congresswoman asking specific stats know top head follow get back congresswoman talk team follow congresswoman said number times going investigate every single app access large amount people information past lock platform imagine find apps either something suspicious misused people data find ban platform take action make sure delete data make sure everyone involved informed soon find yes congressman parts gdpr think important good one making sure people control piece information share used people ability know company knows control setting see able delete whenever want second set things making sure people actually understand tools available settings page somewhere put tools front people make decision builds trust makes inside people experiences configured way want something done number times years facebook gdpr around whole world third piece sensitive technologies think important enable innovation around like face recognition want make sure get special consent right make hard american companies innovate areas like facial recognition lose chinese companies companies around world able innovate congressman think good question think something probably people control used going rolling asking

proactively going work tools take content going rely people flag right think underway efforts focus ads majority questions lot people share stuff groups free part products paid need get content understand big issue unfortunately enforcement perfect need make proactive committed congressman let answer second get last point content reviewers primarily located silicon valley think important point worry general bias people silicon valley majority folks content review around world different places question net neutrality think big difference internet service providers platforms top big reason well think experience starting facebook one choice internet service provider potentially pay extra order make people could facebook option something used sure today platforms many may true lot people choose use facebook average american think uses eight different communication social network apps stay connected people clearly correct true choices platforms even though reach large-scale think pressure one two place require think little bit
